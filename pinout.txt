Connections:
FlySky Receiver to Arduino:

Connect the FlySky receiver's VCC pin to the Arduino's 5V pin.
Connect the FlySky receiver's GND pin to the Arduino's GND pin.
Connect the FlySky receiver's CH1 (Throttle) to Arduino pin A0.
Connect the FlySky receiver's CH2 (Steering) to Arduino pin A1.
Connect additional channels as needed to pins A2, A3, A4, and A5.
Relay Module to Arduino:

Connect the relay module's VCC pin to the Arduino's 5V pin.
Connect the relay module's GND pin to the Arduino's GND pin.
Connect the relay module's IN1 to Arduino pin 6.
Connect the relay module's IN2 to Arduino pin 7.
Connect the relay module's IN3 to Arduino pin 8.
Connect the relay module's IN4 to Arduino pin 9.
Motors to Relay Module:

Left Motors:
Connect the positive terminal of the left front motor to the NO terminal of relay 1.
Connect the positive terminal of the left rear motor to the NO terminal of relay 2.
Connect the negative terminals of both left motors to a common ground.
Right Motors:
Connect the positive terminal of the right front motor to the NO terminal of relay 3.
Connect the positive terminal of the right rear motor to the NO terminal of relay 4.
Connect the negative terminals of both right motors to a common ground.
Connect the COM terminals of all relays to the positive terminal of the power supply for the motors (e.g., battery positive).
This setup ensures that the RC car can be controlled using the FlySky FS-i6X transmitter, and the relay module properly handles the motors' forward and backward movement. Adjust the motor control logic as needed based on your specific motor configuration and relay setup.
